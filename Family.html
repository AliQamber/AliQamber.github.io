    <p>My family has been with me through thick and thin. I wouldnt be where I am today without them... literally! I am grateful for them. My two siblings you have done nothing but make me smile
    and my Mom and Dad whove always helped me with anything, even when I didnt ask for it. I cant wait for you to learn more about them.</p>



    <div id="mother">


    <h3>My Mother</h3>
    <p>Where would I be without this woman. My moms name is Ayda Ali. Shes the most hardworking <del>woman</del> Ive ever seen. Scratch that, shes the most hardworking
    person ever! When shes not working, she loves reading books that are mostly about history and she even watches a couple of history shows/documentaries. She enjoys the sunrise
    and has a passion for nature. Overall, I can easily say, My mother is my greatest inspiration, my greatest motivator. </p>

    <p>My dad has done alot to help me grow. Theres so many things he taught me as a kid and even now that I dont know where I would be with all that hes taught me. My Dad's name is Hassan.
    I consider My Dad to be very athletic. He loves to ride his bike daily. Hes consistanly moving, he moves so much my mom begs from him to stay put for atleast 5 minutes. He cares alot about health
    and making sure he stays strong. The same applies to us, he makes sure we always have healthy habits. After all he cares deeply for all of us.</p>
